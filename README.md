# Facial Recognition using InceptionResNet V1

Face recognition is the general task of identifying and verifying people from photographs of their
face. The 2011 book on face recognition titled “**Handbook of Face Recognition**” describes two main
modes for face recognition, as:

<ol>
  <li>Face Verification: A one-to-one mapping of a given face against a known identity (e.g. is this
the person?)</li>
  <li>Face Identification: A one-to-many mapping for a given face against a database of known
faces (e.g. who is this person?)</li>
</ol>

Deep learning models have revolutionized facial recognition, enabling more accurate and
robust systems compared to traditional methods.

## Traditional vs. Deep Learning Approaches
Traditional facial recognition methods relied on handcrafted features and algorithms, often
struggling with variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions. Deep learning models,
particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), automatically learn hierarchical
representations of facial features, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Facial Recognition
CNNs excel at feature extraction from images, making them well-suited for facial
recognition tasks. These networks consist of convolutional layers that learn spatial
hierarchies of features, capturing details from local to global scales. Pre-trained CNNs,
such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception, have been applied to facial recognition tasks.

## Face Detection
Deep learning models contribute significantly to face detection, the initial step in facial
recognition. Models like MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) and Single
Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) use deep architectures to locate and extract faces from
images.

## Face Verification and Identification
Face verification involves confirming whether two images belong to the same person, while
face identification identifies an individual from a database. Siamese networks and Triplet
networks are popular architectures for face verification, emphasizing learning discriminative
features for accurate matching.

## Loss Functions for Face Recognition
Contrastive loss and Triplet loss are commonly used loss functions in facial recognition
tasks. These functions encourage the network to embed faces of the same identity closer in
the feature space while separating faces of different identities.
